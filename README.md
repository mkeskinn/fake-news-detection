# Fake News Detection

This project is an AI-based system designed to classify news articles as real or fake using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques.

## Problem Statement
The spread of fake news has become a major challenge in the digital age. This project aims to automatically identify misleading or false news content based on textual analysis.

## How It Works
- A news article text is provided as input.
- The text is cleaned and preprocessed using NLP techniques.
- A machine learning model classifies the article as real or fake.

## Dataset
- News articles labeled as real or fake
- Text-based dataset used for supervised learning

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- NLP (Tokenization, Text Vectorization)
- Machine Learning (e.g., Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, SVM)

## Project Structure
- `fake_news_detection.ipynb`: Main notebook containing preprocessing, training, and evaluation
- `README.md`: Project documentation

## Purpose
This project was developed for academic and educational purposes to demonstrate the application of artificial intelligence in misinformation detection.

## Disclaimer
This project does not aim to censor content or replace human judgment. The results are for research and educational purposes only.
